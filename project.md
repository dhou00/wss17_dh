Automated Discovery of Algebraic Structures
-
Algebraic structures are sets equipped with finitary operators satisfying some axiomatic system. These axiomatic systems can be generated by enumerating possible relations involving the operators. This project will attempt the computational discovery of *interesting* structures, first by closely considering the generation of more canonical structures, e.g. semigroups, quasigroups, monoids, loops, groups, etc., then by searching for slow growth rates in terms of the set of instances for other (possibly intermediate) systems.
